This contains a disassembly of the Apple II version of the Cauzin
Softstrip "Stripper" program whic creates Softstrip barcodes. It
prints the codes directly on an Epson printer.

I'm really only interested in knowing the format of the Softstrip so
that I can create them as a PDF.

The disassembly is in [Macroassembler
AS](http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/as/) cross assembler format.
